I had to rename some required files so that PSCode wouldn't delete them.
Here is the list...

Rename:
AudioClient.Ex_ to AudioClient.Exe (Main executable. You can also re-compile vb provject)
AKRip32.Dl_ to AKRip32.Dll (Used for ripping CD)
AKRipAX.Dl_ to AKRipAX.Dll (Also used for ripping CD)
ProgressBar2.oc_ to ProgressBar2.ocx (Hmm, WHat the hell is this?)
lame.ex_ to lame.exe (Backend for encoding MP3's)
